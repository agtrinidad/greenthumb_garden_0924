Established in 1978, GreenThumb is a program providing programming and support to over community gardens in New York City. The entity operates as part of the Department of Parks & Recreation. Before becoming gardens, many of the lots supported by Greenthumb had been vacant and abandoned. Local community volunteers gradually transformed these locations into spaces for socialization, relaxation, and urban agricultural development. Today, GreenThumb works with over 550 individual gardens across the city.

This project had two fundamental goals:
<br>a) Efficient and accurate Python-based data cleaning
<br>b) Visually appealing and effective dashboard creation

The end-product dashboard can be used to draw insights and identify gardens of interest.
